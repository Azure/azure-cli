Welcome to Invoke!
==================

Invoke is a Python (2.7 and 3.4+) library for managing shell-oriented
subprocesses and organizing executable Python code into CLI-invokable tasks. It
draws inspiration from various sources (``make``/``rake``, Fabric 1.x, etc) to
arrive at a powerful & clean feature set.

For a high level introduction, including example code, please see `our main
project website <http://pyinvoke.org>`_; or for detailed API docs, see `the
versioned API website <http://docs.pyinvoke.org>`_.
