Microsoft Azure SDK for Python
==============================

This is the Microsoft Azure Management namespace package.

This package is not intended to be installed directly by the end user.

It provides the necessary files for other packages to extend the azure.mgmt namespace.

If you are looking to install the Azure client libraries, see the
`azure <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure>`__ bundle package.
