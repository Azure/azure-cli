# For all codes, run 'pylint --list-msgs' or go to 'https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference_guide/features.html'
# locally-disabled: Warning locally suppressed using disable-msg
# cyclic-import: because of https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/850
# too-many-arguments: Due to the nature of the CLI many commands have large arguments set which reflect in large arguments set in corresponding methods.
# useless-object-inheritance: Specifies it can be removed from python3 bases, but we also support Python 2.7
# chained-comparison: Does not provide guidance on what would be better and arguably these are fine.
# useless-import-alias: Removing the alias often breaks the import, so it isn't really useless after all.
# useless-suppression: Depends on the Python version and the pylint version...
# wrong-import-order: Pylint keeps changing its mind...
