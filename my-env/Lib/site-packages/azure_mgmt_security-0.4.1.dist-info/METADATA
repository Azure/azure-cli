**General breaking changes**

This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might*
introduce breaking changes if from some import. In summary, some modules
were incorrectly visible/importable and have been renamed. This fixed
several issues caused by usage of classes that were not supposed to be
used in the first place.

  - SecurityCenter cannot be imported from
    `azure.mgmt.security.security_center` anymore (import from
    `azure.mgmt.security` works like before)
  - SecurityCenterConfiguration import has been moved from
    `azure.mgmt.security.security_center` to `azure.mgmt.security`
  - A model `MyClass` from a "models" sub-module cannot be imported
    anymore using `azure.mgmt.security.models.my_class` (import from
    `azure.mgmt.security.models` works like before)
  - An operation class `MyClassOperations` from an `operations`
    sub-module cannot be imported anymore using
    `azure.mgmt.security.operations.my_class_operations` (import
    from `azure.mgmt.security.operations` works like before)

Last but not least, HTTP connection pooling is now enabled by default.
You should always use a client as a context manager, or call close(), or
use no more than one client per process.
