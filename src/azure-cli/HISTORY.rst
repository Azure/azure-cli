2.0.69
++++++

* Minor fixes on SQL vm group that did not allow to update the key for storage accounts.

  the request but returns failure status code and returns an error mesage.
* vm/vmss extension image list: Fix bug where command fails when used with --latest
* vmss create `--single-placement-group`: Removed client-side validation. Does not fail if `--single-placement-group` is
  set to true and`--instance-count` is greater than 100 or availability zones are specified, but leaves this validation
  to the compute service.
* vmss create `--platform-fault-domain-count`: Removed client-side validation. Allows platform fault domain count to be
  specified without specifying zone information, via `--zones`.

**Storage**

* storage blob generate-sas: User delegation SAS token support with --as-user
* storage container generate-sas: User delegation SAS token support with --as-user

2.0.67
++++++
* Introduced a new [Preview] status to tag to more clearly communicate to customers
  when a command group, command or argument is in preview status. This was previously
  called out in help text or communicated implicitly by the command module version number.
  The CLI will be removing version numbers for individual packages in the future, so this
  mechanism will be the sole way to communicate that a feature is in preview. Items which
  are not labeled as being in preview can be considered to be GA. Not that if a command is
  in preview, all of its arguments are as well, and, by extension, if a command group is
  labeled as being in preview, then all commands and arguments are considered to be in
  preview as well.

  As a result of this change, several command groups may seem to "suddenly" appear to be
  in a preview status with this release. What actually happened is that most packages were
  in a preview status, but are being deemed GA with this release.
