Microsoft Azure CLI Dev Tools (azdev)
=====================================

The ``azdev`` tool is designed to aid new and experienced developers in contributing to Azure CLI command modules and extensions.

Setting up your development environment
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Install Python 3.5+ or 2.7+ from http://python.org. Please note that the version of Python that comes preinstalled on OSX is 2.7.

2. Fork and clone the repository or repositories you wish to develop for.
    - For Azure CLI: https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli
    - For Azure CLI Extensions: https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions
    - Any other repository that you might have access to that contains CLI extensions.

3. Create a new virtual environment for Python in the root of your clone. You can do this by running:

    Python 3.5+ (all platforms):

    ::

        python -m venv env

    or:

    ::

        python3 -m venv env

    Python 2.7+ (all platforms):

    ::

        python -m virtualenv env


4. Activate the env virtual environment by running:

    Windows CMD.exe:

    ::

        env\scripts\activate.bat

    Windows Powershell:

    ::

        env\scripts\activate.ps1


    OSX/Linux (bash):

    ::

        source env/bin/activate

5. Install ``azdev`` by running:

    ::

        pip install azdev

6. Complete setup by running:

    ::

        azdev setup


    This will launch the interactive setup process. To see non-interactive options run `azdev setup -h`.

0.1.4
++++++
* `azdev linter`: Fix issue with help example rule.
* `azdev style`: Omit namespace packages from core modules.
* `azdev verify document-map`: Updates to work correctly on Linux.

0.1.3
++++++
* `azdev linter`: Fix issue where certain installations would fail on `ci_exclusions.yml` not found.


0.1.2
++++++
* `azdev setup`: Fix regression where azure.cli could not be run after installation.

0.1.1

* Update for compatability with azure-cli 2.0.68's new package structure.
* BREAKING CHANGE: Removed `azdev cli update-setup`. Package changes to azure-cli no longer require this.
* BREAKING CHANGE: `azdev verify history` and `azdev cli check-versions` no longer accept any arguments. Since there are

* `azdev setup`: Tweaks to interactive experience.
* `azdev test`: Fix issue where using `--profile` did not use the correct index.
                Changed the behavior to switch back to the original profile upon completion of tests.

* Fix issue where `azdev cli check-versions` did not accept the short form of a module name.
* Update `azdev cli check-versions` to allow modules as a positional argument, consistent with other azdev commands.

* Fix critical bug in `azdev setup`.

0.0.3

* Adds new commands `azdev extension build` and `azdev extension publish` to simplify extension publishing.
* Updates default exclusions for `azdev linter` when used on extensions.
* Adds a `--ci-exclusions` flag to `azdev linter` to emulate CI mode when run locally.
* Fix issue where `azdev test --discover` could result in a stack trace when a virtual environment exists within a cloned repo.
* Tweaks thresholds for `azdev per load-times`.

0.0.2
++++++

* Changes the behavior of `azdev test` to, by default, run tests on everything to be consistent with commands like `azdev style` and `azdev linter`.
* Removes `azdev verify version` and splits into two commands `azdev cli check-versions` and `azdev cli update-setup`.
* Various modifications to play nicely with azure-cli's CI build system.
* Revamps `azdev perf load-times` to reduce spurious failures.

0.0.1
++++++
