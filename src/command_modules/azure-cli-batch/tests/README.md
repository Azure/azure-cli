###Setup Instructions

- If recording, set the following environment variables. In playback mode, the account name and url will be read from the recorded file instead, and the key will be set to a default value.
  * AZURE_BATCH_ACCOUNT: The name of the Batch account you're using for recording.
  * AZURE_BATCH_ACCESS_KEY: The key for the Batch account.
  * AZURE_BATCH_ENDPOINT: The url of the account. 
- If recording, create the common test pool and wait for it to reach steady state.
  * Run the following command from the root to create the shared pool: "az batch pool create --json-file batchCreateTestPool.json"
  * Wait for the pool to reach active state, steady allocation state, and to have 3 VMs: "az batch pool show xplatTestPool"
  * Some tests may change the size of the pool, so double check that you still have 3 VMs before recording again.
