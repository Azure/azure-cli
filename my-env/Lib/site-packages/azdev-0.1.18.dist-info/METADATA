Microsoft Azure CLI Dev Tools (azdev)
=====================================

The ``azdev`` tool is designed to aid new and experienced developers in contributing to Azure CLI command modules and extensions.

Setting up your development environment
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Install Python 3.6+ from http://python.org. Please note that the version of Python that comes preinstalled on OSX is 2.7.

2. Fork and clone the repository or repositories you wish to develop for.
    - For Azure CLI: https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli
    - For Azure CLI Extensions: https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions
    - Any other repository that you might have access to that contains CLI extensions.

3. Create a new virtual environment for Python in the root of your clone. You can do this by running:

    Python 3.6+ (all platforms):

    ::

        python -m venv env

    or:

    ::

        python3 -m venv env


4. Activate the env virtual environment by running:

    Windows CMD.exe:

    ::

        env\scripts\activate.bat

    Windows Powershell:

    ::

        env\scripts\activate.ps1


    OSX/Linux (bash):

    ::

        source env/bin/activate

5. Install ``azdev`` by running:

    ::

        pip install azdev

6. Complete setup by running:

    ::

        azdev setup


    This will launch the interactive setup process. To see non-interactive options run `azdev setup -h`.

Release History
===============
0.1.18
++++++
* Linter Rule Severity: Rules now have an associated severity level. Only high severity rules should be run in CI. All previous rules are annotated as HIGH severity.

   * Note: HIGH severity rules are egregious and should generally be fixed, not excluded. LOW severity rules tend to be informational, and might raise false positives. Exclude them via `linter_exclusions.yml` in the CLI.

* `azdev linter`: Expose `--min-severity` to support idea of rule severity. New HIGH, MEDIUM and LOW severity rules have also been added.

0.1.17
++++++
* `azdev setup`: Add option --deps-from to allow resolving dependencies from requirements.txt or setup.py. The default changes to requirements.txt.

0.1.16
++++++
* `azdev test`: Add option --no-exit-first to disable pytest exit once failure is detected

0.1.15
++++++
* `sys.exit(0)` when no tests need to run instead of raising CLIError

0.1.14
++++++
* Refine the logic of testing against different profiles with `ProfileContext`
* pytest version limit change to pytest>=4.4.0
* Use `AzureDevOpsContext` to apply incremental test strategy
* Refine the main flow of azdev test to be more compact and clean

0.1.13
++++++
* azdev verify license: fix bug that license verification will omit files while checking extensions

0.1.12
++++++
* azdev extension publish: fix issue when --yes if not provided
* azdev verify license: support CodeGen generated License
* Drop Python 2 and Python 3.5 support

0.1.9

- azdev extension add/remove:
    - Add ability to supply wildcard (*) to install all available dev extensions.
    - Add ability to remove all installed dev extensions.
- azdev setup:
    - Add ability to install all extensions using `--ext/-e *`.
    - Add ability to install CLI edge build with `--cli/-c EDGE`.
- azdev style/test/linter:
    - Add special names CLI and EXT to allow running on just CLI modules or just extensions.
      extensions which have changed based on a git diff.
- azdev linter:
    - Added `--include-whl-extensions` flag to permit running the linter on extensions installed using
      the `az extension add` command.

0.1.4
++++++
* `azdev linter`: Fix issue with help example rule.
* `azdev style`: Omit namespace packages from core modules.

* Update for compatability with azure-cli 2.0.68's new package structure.
* BREAKING CHANGE: Removed `azdev cli update-setup`. Package changes to azure-cli no longer require this.
* BREAKING CHANGE: `azdev verify history` and `azdev cli check-versions` no longer accept any arguments. Since there are
  now far fewer modules, these were deemed unnecessary.

0.0.6
++++++
* Added new commands `azdev cli create` and `azdev extension create` to scaffold new modules/extensions.
* `azdev setup`: Tweaks to interactive experience.
* `azdev test`: Fix issue where using `--profile` did not use the correct index.
                Changed the behavior to switch back to the original profile upon completion of tests.

++++++
* Fix issue where `azdev cli check-versions` did not accept the short form of a module name.
* Update `azdev cli check-versions` to allow modules as a positional argument, consistent with other azdev commands.
* Fix issue where `azdev test --discover` could result in a stack trace when a virtual environment exists within an extensions repo.

0.0.4
++++++
* Fix critical bug in `azdev setup`.

0.0.3
++++++
* Adds new commands `azdev extension build` and `azdev extension publish` to simplify extension publishing.
* Updates default exclusions for `azdev linter` when used on extensions.
* Adds a `--ci-exclusions` flag to `azdev linter` to emulate CI mode when run locally.
* Fix issue where `azdev test --discover` could result in a stack trace when a virtual environment exists within a cloned repo.
* Tweaks thresholds for `azdev per load-times`.

0.0.2
++++++

* Changes the behavior of `azdev test` to, by default, run tests on everything to be consistent with commands like `azdev style` and `azdev linter`.
* Removes `azdev verify version` and splits into two commands `azdev cli check-versions` and `azdev cli update-setup`.
* Various modifications to play nicely with azure-cli's CI build system.
* Revamps `azdev perf load-times` to reduce spurious failures.

0.0.1
