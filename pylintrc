# cyclic-import: because of https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/850
# import-outside-toplevel: Lazy import to improve performance
# locally-disabled: Warning locally suppressed using disable-msg
# too-many-arguments: Due to the nature of the CLI many commands have large arguments set which reflect in large arguments set in corresponding methods.

# unspecified-encoding: Allow using the system encoding, instead of forcing utf-8 to avoid opening errors
