# Resolve Issues Effectively

Azure CLI is an open-source project. It allows users to create issues in the forum to ask questions, report bugs and provide feedback.

Most issues can be classified into 3 categories. They are
1. Bug report.
2. Feature request.
3. Usage error.

Bug report is one of the most common issues reported in open-source community. Basic steps to resolve a bug report are
1. Confirm the bug.
2. Locate the fault.
3. Fix the bug.

### Confirm the Bug
Confirm whether it is a bug. If you can definitely identify it is a bug according description of the issue, then go to next step. Otherwise, try to reproduce the bug by yourself. You can ask the issue reporter for details such as version, concrete command and logs so that you can understand the issue better and it is more likely to reproduce the bug. It is not rare that it is not a bug, but a usage error instead. Refer to "Usage Error" section.

### Locate the Fault
Fault localization is critical to fix a bug. Some tips:
1. Analyzing logs. It helps you understand the bug.

### Fix the bug
Once you have confirmed the bug and found the fault location, it should be easy to fix the bug. Add a test case if it is missing. Remember to tell users when the fix will released.
