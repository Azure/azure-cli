This checklist is used to make sure that common guidelines for a pull request are followed.

### General Guidelines

- [ ] The PR has modified HISTORY.rst describing any customer-facing, functional changes. Note that this does not include changes only to help content. (see [Modifying change log](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/tree/master/doc/authoring_command_modules#modify-change-log)).

### Command Guidelines

- [ ] Each command and parameter has a meaningful description.
- [ ] Each new command has a test.

(see [Authoring Command Modules](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/tree/master/doc/authoring_command_modules))
