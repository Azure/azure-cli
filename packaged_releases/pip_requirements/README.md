PIP Requirements Log
====================

This directory contains the pip requirements that correspond to these packaged releases.

The files are generated by installing the CLI in a clean virtual environment soon after a packaged release is published then running `pip freeze`.

i.e.  
```
$ pip install --user azure-cli
$ pip freeze --user
```

Installing with the requirements file
-------------------------------------
e.g.  
```
$ pip install -r {VERSION}_python27.txt
```
