Extension Documentation
=======================


What is an Extension?
---------------------

> An extension adds/modifies/removes commands that are part of `az` and can be optionally installed by the user.

- Extensions are supported through all installation methods.
- Extensions are the way to go to release private/public previews of your Azure CLI commands.
- Currently, we support one extension type, a [Python Wheel](http://pythonwheels.com/).
- All extension documentation here refers to this type of extension.

> Extensions should be built with wheel `0.29.0` or `0.30.0` until [#6441](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/6441) is resolved


What an Extension is not
------------------------

- An extension is not an external executable or product outside of `az`.

- If you're looking to create a command module which is installed by default for `az`, see [authoring command modules](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/tree/master/doc/authoring_command_modules).

- If you're looking to build your own CLI using `az` patterns, see [knack](https://github.com/Microsoft/knack).


How to find and install an Extension
------------------------

- List all available extensions: `az extension list-available`

- Install an extension: `az extension install --name <extension-name>`
