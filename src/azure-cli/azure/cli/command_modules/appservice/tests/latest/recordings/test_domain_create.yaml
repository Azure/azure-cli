        \     <p>This Domain Name Registration Agreement (this &quot;<u>Agreement</u>&quot;)
        is entered into by and between Microsoft Azure (&quot;Azure&quot;) and you,
        and is made effective as of the date of electronic acceptance.  This Agreement
        sets forth the terms and conditions of your use of Azure's Domain Name Registration
        services (the &quot;<u>Domain Name Registration Services</u>&quot; or the
        &quot;<u>Services</u>&quot;). The terms &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or
        &quot;our&quot; shall refer to Azure.  The terms &quot;you&quot;, &quot;your&quot;,
        &quot;User&quot; or &quot;customer&quot; shall refer to any individual or

        this Agreement shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits.</p>\\r\\n
        \     <p>Your electronic acceptance of this Agreement signifies that you have
        read, understand, acknowledge and agree to be bound by this Agreement, which
        incorporates by reference each of (i) Azure\u2019s <a href=\\\"https://www.secureserver.net/legal/agreements/universal-terms-of-service-agreement?prog_id=510456&pl_id=510456&plid=510456\\\">Universal

        \     <p><p>You acknowledge and agree that (i) Azure, in its sole and absolute
        discretion, may change or modify this Agreement, and any policies or agreements
        which are incorporated herein, at any time, and such changes or modifications
        shall be effective immediately upon posting to this Site, and (ii) your use

        \ In addition, Azure may occasionally notify you of changes or modifications
        to this Agreement by email.  It is therefore very important that you keep
        your shopper account (\u201C<u>Shopper Account</u>\u201D) information, including
        your email address, current.  Azure assumes no liability or responsibility
        for your failure to receive an email notification if such failure results
        from an inaccurate or out-of-date email address.  Azure is an Internet Corporation
        for Assigned Names and Numbers (&quot;<u>ICANN</u>&quot;) accredited registrar.
        \ \\r</p>\\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that Azure may modify this Agreement
        in order to comply with any terms and conditions set forth by (i) ICANN and/or
        (ii) the registry applicable to the TLD or country code top level domain (&quot;<u>ccTLD</u>&quot;)
        in question. The term \u201CRegistry Service Provider\u201D shall refer to
        the service provider responsible for operating and managing the registry services
        on behalf of the Registry Operator for its applicable TLD or ccTLD.  To identify

        \ </strong>\\r\\n\\r\\n      <p><p><em>Unless otherwise noted, the provisions
        below in this Section 2 are generally applicable to all TLDs that we offer.
        \ Special provisions specific to any TLD or ccTLD (those in addition to posted
        Registry Policies) are identified elsewhere below in this Agreement.</em>
        \ \\r</p>\\n<p><ol><li><em><u>Registry Policies.</u></em> You agree to be
        bound by all Registry Policies (defined above in this Agreement) applicable
        to your domain name registration (at any level). IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
        TO VISIT THE APPLICABLE TLD SITE AND READ AND REVIEW ALL APPLICABLE REGISTRY
        POLICIES PRIOR TO YOUR REGISTRATION IN THE TLD.  REGISTRY POLICIES FOR EACH
        TLD CAN BE FOUND BY VISITING THE CORRESPONDING TLD LINK LISTED<a href=\\\"https://www.secureserver.net/legal/agreements/tld-registry-policies?prog_id=510456&pl_id=510456&plid=510456\\\">HERE</a>.
        Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Registry Operator
        of the TLD in which the domain name registration is made is and shall be an
        intended third party beneficiary of this Agreement. As such the parties to
        this agreement acknowledge and agree that the third party beneficiary rights
        of the Registry Operator have vested and that the Registry Operator has relied
        on its third party beneficiary rights under this Agreement in agreeing to
        Azure being a registrar for the respective TLD. The third party beneficiary
        rights of the Registry Operator will survive any termination of this Agreement.</li>
        \ </p>\\n</p>\\r\\n      <p><li><em><u>Registration Requirements.</u></em>
        To the extent any TLD or ccTLD requires you meet eligibility (e.g., residency
        for .JP, .EU, etc.), validation (e.g., DNS validation) or other authentication
        requirements as a condition to registering a domain name in the TLD, you agree
        that by submitting an application or registering or renewing your domain name,
        you represent and warrant that: (a) all information provided to register or
        renew the domain name (including all supporting documents, if any) is true,
        complete and correct, and is not misleading in any way, and the application
        is made in good faith; (b) you meet, and will continue to meet, the eligibility
        criteria prescribed in the Registry Policies for the applicable TLD for the
        duration of the domain name registration; (c) you have not previously submitted
        an application for the domain name with another registrar using the same eligibility
        criteria, and the other registrar has rejected the application (if applicable);
        (d) you acknowledge and agree that even if the domain name is accepted for
        registration, your entitlement to register the domain name may be challenged
        by others who claim to have an entitlement to the domain name; and (e) you
        acknowledge and agree that the Registry or the registrar can cancel the registration
        of the domain name if any of the warranties required are found to be untrue,
        incomplete, incorrect or misleading.</li>  </p>\\r\\n      <p><li><em><u>Ownership.</u></em>
        You acknowledge and agree that registration of a domain name does not create
        any proprietary right for you, the registrar, or any other person in the name
        used as a domain name or the domain name registration and that the entry of
        a domain name in the Registry shall not be construed as evidence or ownership
        of the domain name registered as a domain name. You shall not in any way transfer
        or purport to transfer a proprietary right in any domain name registration
        or grant or purport to grant as security or in any other manner encumber or
        purport to encumber a domain name registration.</li>  \\r</p>\\r\\n      <p><li><em><u>ICANN
        Requirements.</u></em> You agree to comply with the ICANN requirements, standards,
        policies, procedures, and practices for which each applicable Registry Operator
        has monitoring responsibility in accordance with the Registry Agreement between
        ICANN and itself or any other arrangement with ICANN. For additional ICANN-related
        helpful information, please see <a href=\\\"https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/educational-2012-02-25-en\\\">ICANN

        Benefits and Responsibilities</a>.</li>  \\r</p>\\r\\n      <p><li><em><u>Indemnification
        of Registry.</u></em>  You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless (within
        30 days of demand) the Registry Operator and Registry Service Provider and
        their subcontractors, subsidiaries, affiliates, divisions, shareholders, directors,
        officers, employees, accountants, attorneys, insurers, agents, predecessors,
        successors and assigns, from and against any and all claims, demands, damages,
        losses, costs, expenses, causes of action or other liabilities of any kind,

        and expenses, in any way arising out of, relating to, or otherwise in connection
        with the your domain name registration, including, without limitation, the
        use, registration, extension, renewal, deletion, and/or transfer thereof and/or
        the violation of any applicable terms or conditions governing the registration.
        You shall not enter into any settlement or compromise of any such indemnifiable
        claim without Registrar\u2019s or Registry Operator\u2019s prior written consent,
        which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and you agree that these
        indemnification obligations shall survive the termination or expiration of
        the Agreement for any reason.  IN NO EVENT SHALL THE REGISTRY OPERATOR BE
        LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
        SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFIT OR GOODWILL,
        FOR ANY MATTER, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY IS ASSERTED ON THE BASIS OF CONTRACT,

        DAMAGES.</li>  \\r</p>\\r\\n      <p><li><em><u>Regulated TLDs.</u></em> For
        domain name registration in any \u201CRegulated\u201D TLD, you acknowledge
        and agree your registration is subject to the following additional requirements:

        TLDs.</u></em> In addition to the requirements for Regulated TLDs, domain
        name registration in any Highly-Regulated TLD is subject to the following
        requirements: (a) you will provide administrative contact information, which
        must be kept up\u2010to\u2010date, for the notification of complaints or reports
        of registration abuse, as well as the contact details of the relevant regulatory,
        or Industry self\u2010regulatory, bodies in their main place of business;
        (b) you represent that you possess any necessary authorizations, charters,
        licenses and/or other related credentials for participation in the sector
        associated with such Highly\u2010regulated TLD; and (c) you will report any
        material changes to the validity of you authorizations, charters, licenses
        and/or other related credentials for participation in the sector associated
        with the Highly\u2010regulated TLD to ensure you continue to conform to the
        appropriate regulations and licensing requirements and generally conduct your
        activities in the interests of the consumers they serve.  Highly Regulated
        TLDs include: _.abogado, .attorney, .bank, .bet, .bingo, .casino .charity

        to the Registrar and Registry, upon request, that they hold the applicable
        license.</li>  </p>\\n</p>\\r\\n      <p><li><em><u>Special Safeguard TLDs.</u></em>
        In addition to the requirements for Regulated and Highly-Regulated TLDs, by
        registering a domain name in any \u201CSpecial-Safeguard\u201D TLD, you agree
        to take reasonable steps to avoid misrepresenting or falsely implying that
        you or your business is affiliated with, sponsored or endorsed by one or more
        country's or government's military forces if such affiliation, sponsorship
        or endorsement does not exist.  Special Safeguard TLDs include:  <em>.army,
        .navy, .airforce</em></li></p>\\r\\n      <p><li><em><u>Third Party Beneficiary.</u></em>
        Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Registry Operator
        for any TLD in which your register a domain name is and shall be an intended
        third party beneficiary of this Agreement. As such the parties to this agreement
        acknowledge and agree that the third party beneficiary rights of the Registry
        Operator have vested and that the Registry Operator has relied on its third
        party beneficiary rights under this Agreement in agreeing to Azure being a
        registrar for the TLD. Third party beneficiary rights of the Registry Operator
        shall survive any termination of this Agreement.</li>  \\r</p>\\r\\n      <p><li><em><u>Variable
        and Non-Uniform Pricing.</u></em> You acknowledge, understand and agree that
        certain domain names in certain TLDs are established by Registry Policies
        to be variably priced (i.e., standard v. premium names) and/or may have non-uniform
        renewal registration pricing (such that the Fee for a domain name registration
        renewal may differ from other domain names in the same TLD, e.g., renewal
        registration for one domain may be $100.00 and $33.00 for a different domain
        name).</li>  \\r</p>\\r\\n        <strong></ol><strong>3. FEES AND PAYMENTS</strong></strong>\\r\\n\\r\\n
        \     <p><p><strong>(A) GENERAL TERMS, INCLUDING AUTOMATIC RENEWAL TERMS</strong></p>\\n<p>You
        agree to pay any and all prices and fees due for Services purchased or obtained
        at this Site at the time you order the Services.  Azure expressly reserves
        the right to change or modify its prices and fees at any time, and such changes
        or modifications shall be posted online at this Site and effective immediately
        without need for further notice to you.  If you have purchased or obtained
        Services for a period of months or years, changes or modifications in prices
        and fees shall be effective when the Services in question come up for renewal
        as further described below.   \\r</p>\\n<p>Unless otherwise specifically noted
        (for reasons such as those highlighted in Section 2(x) above), the renewal
        price for any domain name in any TLD will be the same as the list (non-sale)
        price shown when you search for and select a domain, and again in the cart
        prior to purchase.  For example, if the list price is $9.99, and a different
        renewal price is not specifically identified, then the renewal price is also
        $9.99.  Likewise, if a domain name has a sale price of $8.99, with the list
        (non-sale) price shown (as a strike-through) at $9.99, the renewal price will
        be $9.99*.  \\r</p>\\n<p><small>* Renewal price subject to change prior to
        actual date of renewal.</small>  \\r</p>\\n<p>For all other terms and conditions
        relating to fees, payment, refund and billing, etc. applicable to the Services
        offered under the scope of this Agreement, please refer to the \u201CFees
        and Payments\u201D section of our <a href=\\\"https://www.secureserver.net/legal/agreements/universal-terms-of-service-agreement?prog_id=510456&pl_id=510456&plid=510456\\\">Universal
        Terms of Service</a>.   \\r</p>\\n</p>\\r\\n      <p><p><strong>(B) DOMAIN
        NAME RENEWAL TERMS</strong></p>\\n<p>When you register a domain name, you
        will have the following renewal options: </p>\\n<p><ol><li><em>Automatic Renewal.</em>
        Automatic Renewal is the default setting. Domain names will automatically
        renew, for a period equivalent to the length of your original domain name
        registration, and payment will be taken from the Payment Method you have on
        file with Azure, at Azure's then current rates. Thus, if you have chosen to
        register your domain name for one (1) year, Azure will automatically renew
        it for one (1) year. If you have chosen to register your domain name for two
        (2) years, Azure will automatically renew it for two (2) years, and so on.
        If you wish to change your automatic renewal term to a different period from
        your original term,  as of 16 July 2020, you may manually renew the domain
        registration to establish a new default automatic renewal term for the domain.</li></p>\\n</p>\\r\\n
        \     <p><li><em>Manual Renewal.</em>  If you have elected to turn off automatic

        Manager</a> and manually implementing the renewal or by calling customer service
        (should you in fact want the domain name to be renewed). If you fail to manually

        by the terms of this Agreement (as amended) for all renewed domains.  Domain
        name renewals will be non-refundable. In the event that we are unable to automatically
        renew your domain name for the renewal option selected for any reason, we
        may automatically renew your domain name for a period less than your original
        registration period to the extent necessary for the transaction to succeed.
        If for any reason Azure is not able to take the payment from the Payment Method

        after the expiration date of the domain name. If you do not reimburse Azure
        for the renewal during the Renewal Grace Period your domain name will be placed
        on Hold and flagged for deletion after which you may have up to a 30-day redemption
        period to redeem your domain name, provided that your domain name is not subject
        to an expired domain name auction bid and you pay Azure a Redemption fee.
        </p>\\n<p>The Redemption fee is displayed at checkout and is subject to change
        under the terms of this Agreement. If you do not redeem your domain name prior

        delete your domain name or transfer it to another registrant on your behalf.

        five (5) days after registration.  In the event a free domain name is offered
        with the registration of another domain and if the paid domain name registered
        fails, then we may, in our sole discretion, either delete the registration
        of the free domain or refund the difference between the amount paid and the
        value of the free domain.  Failed registrations associated with promotional
        offers may result in the deletion of the free or discounted item or an adjustment
        between the registered domain price and the value of the discounted item,

        AGREEMENT; TRANSFERS; DOMAIN TASTING</strong>  </strong>\\r\\n\\r\\n      <p>The

        you have any domain name registered through Azure.  \\r</p>\\r\\n      <p>You
        agree that you will not transfer any domain name registered through Azure
        to another domain name registrar during the first sixty (60) days after its

        name for ten (10) days after a Change of Account.  \\r</p>\\r\\n      <p>You
        further agree that you will not engage in &quot;domain tasting&quot; by using
        the five (5) day grace period in which a registrant may choose to cancel a
        domain name and get a full refund of the registration fee as a vehicle to
        test the marketability or viability of a domain name.  If Azure determines
        (which determination shall be made by Azure in its sole and absolute discretion)
        that you have been engaging in &quot;domain tasting&quot;, then Azure reserves
        the right to (a) charge you a small fee (which fee shall be deducted from
        any refund issued) or (b) refuse your cancellation/refund request altogether.
        Azure will not charge you a fee if Azure cancels your domain name during the
        five (5) day grace period due to fraud or other activity outside of your control.
        The five (5) day grace period does not apply to Premium Domains, which are
        non-refundable.  \\r</p>\\r\\n      <p>You agree that Azure shall not be bound
        by (i) any representations made by third parties who you may use to purchase
        services from Azure, or (ii) any statements of a general nature, which may
        be posted on Azure's website or contained in Azure's promotional materials.</p>\\r\\n

        to keep this information in a current and accurate status. Failure by you,
        for whatever reason, to provide Azure with accurate and reliable information
        on an initial and continual basis, shall be considered to be a material breach
        of this Agreement and a basis for suspension and/or cancellation of the domain
        name. Failure by you, for whatever reason, to respond within five (5) business
        days to any inquiries made by Azure to determine the validity of information
        provided by you, shall also be considered to be a material breach of this
        Agreement and a basis for suspension and/or cancellation of the domain name.

        they become effective. You agree that by maintaining your domain name registrations
        with Azure after the updated policy becomes effective that you agree to the

        periodically to determine if changes have been made to the Dispute Resolution
        Policy. If you cancel or terminate your Services with Azure as a result of
        the modified Dispute Resolution policy, no fees will be refunded to you. You

        Suspension System, if applicable. </p>\\r\\n      <p>You agree that if a dispute
        arises as a result of one (1) or more domain names you have registered using

        may take whatever action Azure deems necessary regarding further modification,
        assignment of and/or control of the domain name deemed necessary to comply
        with the actions or requirements of the governmental, administrative or judicial
        body until such time as the dispute is settled. In this event you agree to
        hold Azure harmless for any action taken by Azure.</p>\\r\\n      <p>You agree

        servers, or are using our systems to forward a domain name, URL, or otherwise
        to a system or site hosted elsewhere, or if you have your domain name registered
        with Azure, you are responsible for ensuring there is no excessive overloading
        on Azure\u2019s servers. You may not use Azure\u2019s servers and your domain
        name as a source, intermediary, reply to address, or destination address for

        the event Azure refuses a registration or deletes an existing registration
        during the first thirty (30) days after registration, you will receive a refund
        of any fees paid to Azure in connection with the registration either being
        cancelled or refused. In the event Azure deletes the registration of a domain
        name being used in association with spam or morally objectionable activities,
        no refund will be issued.</p>\\n</p>\\r\\n        <strong><strong>10. DEFAULT

        Domain Name Settings.</u>  When you register a domain name with Azure, you
        will be prompted to choose your domain name settings during the checkout process.
        \ If you plan on using another provider for your website or hosting needs,
        then you should enter the name servers of such provider when you choose your
        domain name settings.  This will direct your domain name away from Azure\u2019s
        name servers.  If you are an existing Azure customer and have already set
        up a customer profile designating your domain name settings for new domain
        name registrations, you will not need to complete this step again during the
        checkout process.   </p>\\r\\n      <p><u>Azure\u2019s Default Settings.</u>

        that Azure may display both (a) in-house advertising (which includes links
        to Azure products and services) and (b) third-party advertising (which includes

        described above.  As used in this paragraph, \u201Cexpiration\u201D is deemed

        used as an alternative to renewals, you may only use the service on each domain
        once in any 12-month period. The service may only be used on domain names

        is provided to facilitate the buying of currently registered domain names
        only, and not the purchase or sale of associated website content.. Azure provides
        a venue and a transaction facilitation process and will take a stated commission
        for each completed transaction. Azure is not an escrow agent. As a result,
        Azure does not guarantee the quality, safety or legality of many of the domain
        names. Domain names listed may be withdrawn at any time by the seller or by
        us.  You acknowledge and agree that your transaction will be handled by Azure's
        \u201CTransaction Assurance\u201D process. By using Azure's \u201CTransaction
        Assurance\u201D process, you authorize Azure to perform tasks on your behalf
        in order to complete the transaction.  In these transactions, Azure acts as
        a transaction facilitator to help you buy and sell domain names. Azure will
        not use your funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes,
        and will not voluntarily make funds available to its creditors in the event
        of bankruptcy or for any other purpose. You acknowledge Azure is not a bank
        and the service is a payment processing service rather than a banking service.
        You further acknowledge Azure is not acting as a trustee, fiduciary or escrow
        with respect to your funds. In all transactions, where the domain name is
        registered to us, domain names purchased through the Service may not be transferred
        away from us to another registrar for a period of sixty (60) days following
        the change of registrant date.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Your Obligations.</strong><br><br><strong>Purchasing

        the registration fee will be added to the price to form the purchase price.
        You agree that by completing the transaction, You are responsible for payment
        of the registration fee. We will obtain the funds first by the Payment Method
        You have designated. If there are insufficient funds or invalid credit card
        information, we may obtain the remaining funds by charging any Payment Method
        You have on file.<br><br>Azure will remit payment of the full agreed upon
        purchase price minus any commissions to the Seller after a prescribed period
        of time after receiving funds from the Buyer, except in the event of a dispute
        or where the payment is suspected to be fraudulent, as determined by Azure
        in its sole and absolute discretion. At no time will You be able to withdraw
        those funds or send the funds to another recipient unless the initial transaction
        is canceled. Transfer of Registration Rights. We are not the registrant of

        \ Registrants are not required to register all variants in a bundle, but all
        registered variants must be registered and managed at a single registrar.
        Each variant registered will incur a registration fee.  In addition, when

        it may result in an &quot;unavailable&quot; search result, delayed or failed

        />\\n.CN is a restricted TLD \u2013 applications are subject to both a domain
        name check <strong><em>and</em></strong> real name verification as required
        by the People\u2019s Republic of China.  Registrations in .CN are therefore
        subject to the following additional terms:</p>\\n<p><u><em>Verification, Registration
        and Activation</em></u>.  If a domain name is not permitted to be registered
        by the Chinese government, as determined by us, the Registry Operator and/or
        a 3rd party provider utilized for such services and determinations, in either
        party\u2019s discretion, the application for registration will not be successful.
        \ In such event, the name will be deleted and you will be eligible for a refund
        as further described below.</p>\\n<p>If permitted, then the Registration may
        proceed, but a .CN domain name may not be activated (i.e., it will not resolve
        in the Internet) <u><em>unless and until</em></u> you have submitted (via
        the process described during registration) valid documents required of us
        and the Registry to perform real name verification.  The following are acceptable
        forms of documents for the purpose of verification:\\r\\n</p>\\n<ul><li>China:
        Resident ID, temporary resident ID, business license or organization code
        certificate</li>\\r\\n\\r\\n<li>Hong Kong/Macau: Resident ID, driver\u2019s
        license, passport or business license</li>\\r\\n\\r\\n<li>Singapore: Driver\u2019s

        ID, driver\u2019s license or business license</li>\\r\\n\\r\\n<li>Other Countries/Regions:
        Driver\u2019s license or passport</li></ul>\\r\\n<p>Documents submitted to
        us are used by us and shared with the Registry solely for the purpose of real
        name verification, and are otherwise subject to our <a href=\\\"https://www.secureserver.net/legal/agreements/privacy-policy?prog_id=510456&pl_id=510456&plid=510456\\\">Privacy
        Policy</a>.  By registering a .CN domain, you expressly agree that your data
        may be stored on servers in the U.S., or otherwise outside of the People's
        Republic of China.</p>\\n<p><u><em>Refunds</em></u>.  Refunds for .CN Registrations
        will only be allowed where (i) registration of the applied for domain name
        is not permitted by the Chinese government; or (ii) you notify us of your
        intent to cancel for any reason within the first five (5) days after the Registration
        (i.e., after it is deemed permissible by the Chinese government).  For the
        avoidance of doubt, refunds will not be permitted under any circumstances
        after five (5) days from the date of Registration, including, for example,
        in the event real name verification is not successful or if the Chinese government
        determines after Registration that the domain name should not have been registered
        (and directs us to delete).</p>\\n</p>\\r\\n      <p><p><strong><em>(D) PROVISIONS

        Restrictions</em></u>.  You represent and warrant that you have a local presence
        in Japan with a home or office address. You agree that certain domain names

        5; and/or</li><li>You elect to cancel DBP's services for any reason --</li></ol>Neither

        \       <strong><strong>5 . COMMUNICATIONS FORWARDING</strong> </strong>\\r\\n\\r\\n
        \ <p><p><strong>a. Correspondence Forwarding</strong>  \\r</p>\\n<p>Inasmuch
        as DBP's name, postal address and phone number will be listed in the Whois
        directory, You agree DBP will review and forward communications addressed
        to Your domain name that are received via email, certified or traceable courier
        mail (such as UPS, FedEx, or DHL), or first class U.S. postal mail. You specifically
        acknowledge DBP will not forward to You first class postal mail (other than
        legal notices), &quot;junk&quot; mail or other unsolicited communications
        (whether delivered through email, fax, postal mail or telephone), and You
        further authorize DBP to either discard all such communications or return
        all such communications to sender unopened. You agree to waive any and all
        claims arising from Your failure to receive communications directed to Your
        domain name but not forwarded to You by DBP. <br />\\n<br />\\n<strong>b.
        Email Forwarding</strong><br />\\n<br />\\nThe Whois directory requires an
        email address for every purchased domain name registration. When You purchase
        a private domain registration, DBP creates a private email address for that
        domain name, &quot;@domainsbyproxy.com&quot;. Thereafter, when messages are
        sent to that private email address, DBP handles them according to the email
        preference You selected for that particular domain name. You have three (3)
        email preferences from which to choose. You can elect to:<br />\\n</p>\\n<ol
        type=i>\\r\\n<li>Have all of the messages forwarded;</li>\\r\\n<li> Have all
        of the messages filtered for Spam and then forwarded; or</li>\\r\\n<li>Have
        none of the messages forwarded.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<p><br />\\nAs with all
        communications, You agree to waive any and all claims arising from Your failure
        to receive email directed to Your domain name but not forwarded to You by
        DBP.</p>\\n<p><strong>c. Notifications Regarding Correspondence and Your Obligation
        to Respond</strong><br />\\nWhen DBP receives certified or traceable courier
        mail or legal notices addressed to Your domain name, in most cases, DBP will
        attempt to forward the mail to you via email. If You do not respond to the
        DBP email and/or the correspondence DBP has received regarding Your domain
        name registration concerns a dispute of any kind or otherwise requires immediate
        disposition, DBP may immediately reveal Your identity and/or cancel the DBP
        private registration service regarding either the domain name registration(s)
        in question. This means the Whois directory will revert to displaying Your
        name, postal address, email address and phone number that you provided to
        DBP.<br />\\n<br />\\n<strong>d. Additional Administrative Fees</strong><br
        />\\n<br />\\nDBP reserves the right to charge You reasonable &quot;administrative
        fees&quot; or &quot;processing fees&quot; for (i)  tasks DBP may perform outside
        the normal scope of its Services, (ii) additional time and/or costs DBP may
        incur in providing its Services, and/or (iii) Your non-compliance with the
        Agreement (as determined by DBP in its sole and absolute discretion). Typical
        administrative or processing fee scenarios include, but are not limited to,
        (i) customer service issues that require additional personal time and attention;
        (ii) disputes that require accounting or legal services, whether performed
        by DBP staff or by outside firms retained by DBP; (iii) recouping any and
        all costs and fees, including the cost of Services, incurred by DBP as the
        result of chargebacks or other payment disputes brought by You, Your bank
        or Payment Method processor.  These administrative fees or processing fees
        will be billed to the Payment Method You have on file with Your Registrar.</p>\\n<p>You
        agree to waive the right to trial by jury in any proceeding that takes place
        relating to or arising out of this Agreement.  </p>\\n</p>\\r\\n        <strong><strong>6

        Severability; Construction; Entire Agreement</strong><br />\\n<br />\\nIf
        any part of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, unenforceable or invalid,
        in whole or in part, such provision shall be modified to the minimum extent
        necessary to make it legal, enforceable and valid, and the legality, enforceability
        and validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected
        or impaired. The headings herein will not be considered a part of this Agreement.
        You agree this Agreement, including the policies it incorporates by reference,
        constitute the complete and only Agreement between You and DBP regarding the
        services contemplated herein.   \\r</p>\\n<p><strong>b. Governing Law; Venue;
        Waiver Of Trial By Jury</strong><br />\\n<br />\\nThis Agreement shall be
        governed in all respects by the laws and judicial decisions of Maricopa County,
        Arizona, excluding its conflicts of laws rules. Except as provided immediately
        below, You agree that any action relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
        shall be brought exclusively in the courts of Maricopa County, Arizona. For

        <br />\\n<br />\\nIn the unlikely event You lose Your domain name registration

        (the &quot;Indemnifying Party&quot;) will indemnify and hold You harmless
        against any losses, damages or costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees)
        resulting from any claim, action, proceeding, suit or demand arising out of
        or related to the loss of Your domain name registration. Such indemnification
        obligations under this Section 10(e) are conditioned upon the following:<br
        />\\n<br />\\n</p>\\n<ol type=i>\\r\\n<li>That You promptly give both DBP
