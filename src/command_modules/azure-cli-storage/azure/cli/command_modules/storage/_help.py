helps['storage entity insert'] = """
    type: command
    short-summary: Insert an entity into the table.
    long-summary: Inserts an entity into the table. When inserting an entity into a table, you must specify values for the PartitionKey and RowKey system properties. Together, these properties form the primary key and must be unique within the table. Both the PartitionKey and RowKey values may be up to 64 KB in size. If you are using an integer value as a key, you should convert the integer to a fixed-width string, because they are canonically sorted. For example, you should convert the value 1 to 0000001 to ensure proper sorting.
    parameters:
