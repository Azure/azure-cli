A great cloud needs great tools; we're excited to introduce *Azure CLI*, our next generation multi-platform command line experience for Azure.

Take a test run now from Azure Cloud Shell!

## Installation

Please refer to the [install guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) for detailed install instructions.

A list of common install issues and their resolutions are available at [install troubleshooting](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/dev/doc/install_troubleshooting.md).

### Developer Installation (see below)

- [Docker](#docker)
- [Edge Builds](#edge-builds)
- [Developer Setup](#developer-setup)

## Usage

```bash
$ az [ group ] [ subgroup ] [ command ] {parameters}
```

### Get Started

Please refer to the ["get started" guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-az-cli2) for in-depth instructions.

For usage and help content, pass in the `-h` parameter, for example:

```bash
$ az storage -h
$ az vm create -h
```

### Highlights

Here are a few features and concepts that can help you get the most out of the Azure CLI.

![Azure CLI Highlight Reel](doc/assets/AzBlogAnimation4.gif)

The following examples are showing using the `--output table` format, you can change your default using the `az configure` command.

#### Tab Completion

We support tab-completion for groups, commands, and some parameters

```bash
# looking up resource group and name
$ az vm show -g [tab][tab]
AccountingGroup   RGOne  WebPropertiesRG

$ az vm show -g WebPropertiesRG -n [tab][tab]
StoreVM  Bizlogic

$ az vm show -g WebPropertiesRG -n Bizlogic
```

#### Query

You can use the `--query` parameter and the [JMESPath](http://jmespath.org/) query syntax to customize your output.

```bash
$ az vm list --query "[?provisioningState=='Succeeded'].{ name: name, os: storageProfile.osDisk.osType }"
Name                    Os
----------------------  -------
storevm                 Linux
bizlogic                Linux
demo32111vm             Windows
dcos-master-39DB807E-0  Linux
```

#### Creating a VM
The following block creates a new resource group in the 'westus' region, then creates a new Ubuntu VM.  We automatically provide a series of smart defaults, such as setting up SSH with your  `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` key.  For more details, try `az vm create -h`.

```bash
$ az group create -l westus -n MyGroup
Name     Location
-------  ----------
MyGroup  westus

$ az vm create -g MyGroup -n MyVM --image ubuntults
MacAddress         ResourceGroup    PublicIpAddress    PrivateIpAddress
-----------------  ---------------  -----------------  ------------------
00-0D-3A-30-B2-D7  MyGroup          52.160.111.118     10.0.0.4

$ ssh 52.160.111.118
Welcome to Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.19.0-65-generic x86_64)

#### Exit Codes
For scripting purposes, we output certain exit codes for differing scenarios.

|Exit Code   |Scenario   |
|---|---|
|0  |Command ran successfully.   |
|1   |Generic error; server returned bad status code, CLI validation failed, etc.   |
|2   |Parser error; check input to command line.   |
|3   |Missing ARM resource; used for existence check from `show` commands.   |

#### More Samples and Snippets
For more usage examples, take a look at our [GitHub samples repo](http://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-samples) or [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/overview).

## Reporting issues and feedback

If you encounter any bugs with the tool please file an issue in the [Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues) section of our GitHub repo.

To provide feedback from the command line, try the `az feedback` command.

## Developer Installation

### Docker

We maintain a Docker image preconfigured with the Azure CLI.
See our [Docker tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/azure-cli/tags/) for available versions.

```bash
$ docker run -v ${HOME}:/root -it microsoft/azure-cli:<version>
```

For automated builds triggered by pushes to this repo, see [azuresdk/azure-cli-python](https://hub.docker.com/r/azuresdk/azure-cli-python/tags).
For example:
```bash
docker run -v ${HOME}:/root -it azuresdk/azure-cli-python:dev
```

### Edge Builds

If you want to get the latest build from the `dev` branch, you can use our "edge" builds feed. Here's an example of
installing edge dev builds with pip in a virtual environment.

```bash
$ virtualenv env
$ . env/bin/activate
$ pip install --pre azure-cli --extra-index-url https://azurecliprod.blob.core.windows.net/edge
```

To upgrade your current edge build pass the `--upgrade` option. The `--no-cache-dir` option is also recommended since
the feed is frequently updated.

```bash
$ pip install --upgrade --pre azure-cli --extra-index-url https://azurecliprod.blob.core.windows.net/edge --no-cache-dir
```

The edge build is generated for each push to the `dev` branch as a part of the Travis CI build. The version of the edge build follows
