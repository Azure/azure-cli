# Pull Request Engagement Rules

## Why do we need these rules

We have 20 PR (pull request) opened on an average day, more when it is closer to final days of a sprint. Reviewing pull request cost time and energy. Automation jobs triggered by the PR also constantly compete for the finite resources.

To better facilitate the reviewing process to ensure PR are reviewed and closed in timely fashion the engineering team set up the engagement rules to define when and how we will begin review pull requests.

## What to do when open a PR

### Pick a good subject

Make the subject line clear and concise. Make it clear what area this PR indents to change.

Good examples:

    * [Maps] Add premium SDK support
    * [Batch] Enable token credential for cloudshell
    * [AKS] handle monitoring solution through its subscription ID

Bad examples:

    * fix the wrong help
    * Update _help.py
    * not all VMSS autoscale settings has notifications, we need to verify â€¦

### More information in the PR body

In additional to the subject line, following details should be specified in the PR body:

* [Required] The milestone: Make it clear what sprint you expect to have this change shipped. We will prioritize the PR for nearest milestone.
* [Required] The associcated issues.
* [Optional] The area / command module this PR is intended for.
* [Optional] Concerns

### Skip CI

If the PR only touches documentation, add `[skip ci]` to the subject line. [Reference](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/#Skipping-a-build)

## Prerequisit of code review

* The CI must pass
* The PR is for current sprint (unless there is no open PR in current sprint)
* If it is a bug fix, there must be an issue associcated with it.
