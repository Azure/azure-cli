Hi, this inquiry has been well received albeit being triaged as non-security related ask.

Azure CLI is currently prioritizing direct SFI requirements and items and this request does not seem to be related to SFI. We'll retain it in our backlog at this point. Please reach out to AzPyCli@microsoft.com if you'd justify it's highly customer-impacted and need to be escalated.

Thank you,

Azure CLI team
