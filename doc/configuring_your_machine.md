Setting up your development environment
========================================
The Azure Python CLI projects sources are located on GitHub (https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/). In order to contribute to the project, you are expected to: 
-	Have a GitHub account. For Microsoft contributors, follow the guidelines on https://opensourcehub.microsoft.com/ to create, configure and link your account
-	Fork the  https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/ repository into your private GitHub account
-	Create pull requests against the https://github.com/azure/azure-cli repository to get your code changes merged into the project repository.

##Docker Setup
If you have not previously done so, configure your Docker client engine [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).

Then:
+ Run `docker login` (contact the team for credentials).
+ Run `docker pull azuresdk/azure-cli-python:latest`
+ Run `docker run -i -t azuresdk/azure-cli-python:latest`

##Preparing your machine
1.	Install Python 3.5.x from http://python.org. Please note that the version of Python that comes preinstalled on OSX is 2.7. 
2.	Clone your repository and check out the master branch.
3.	Create a new virtual environment “env” for Python 3.5 in the root of your clone. You can do this by running:

  #####Windows
  ```BatchFile
  python -m venv <clone root>\env
  ```
  #####OSX/Ubuntu (bash)
  ```Shell
  python –m venv <clone root>/env
  ```
4.  Activate the env virtual environment by running:

  #####Windows
  ```BatchFile
  <clone root>\env\scripts\activate.bat
  ```
  #####OSX/Ubuntu (bash)
  ```Shell
  . <clone root>/env/bin/activate
  ```

5.	Install the dependencies and load the command modules as local packages using pip.
  ```Shell
  python scripts/dev_setup.py
  ```
6.  Add `<clone root>\src` to your PYTHONPATH environment variable:

  #####Windows
  ```BatchFile
  set PYTHONPATH=<clone root>\src;%PYTHONPATH%
  ```
  #####OSX/Ubuntu (bash)
  ```Shell
  export PYTHONPATH=<clone root>/src:${PYTHONPATH}
  ```
7.  Setup tab completion (OSX/Ubuntu ONLY).

  Open Bash or zsh window and run:
  
  ```Shell
  source ./az.completion.sh
  ```

##Configuring your IDE
####Visual Studio (Windows only)
1.	Install Python Tools for Visual Studio. As of 2/18/2016, the current version (PTVS 2.2) can be found at http://microsoft.github.io/PTVS/.
2.	Open the azure-cli.pyproj project
You should now be able to launch your project by pressing F5/start debugging

####Visual Studio Code (Any platform)
Experimental steps – still haven’t been able to get virtual environments to work well with VSCode

1.	Install VS Code
2.	Install (one of) the python extension(s) (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python)
Debugging should now work (including stepping and setting breakpoints). 

The repo has a launch.json file that will launch the version of Python that is first on your path. 

##Running CLI
####Command line
1.  Activate your virtual environment if not already done

  #####Windows:
  ```BatchFile
  <clone root>\env\scripts\activate.bat
  ```
2.  Invoke the CLI using:

  #####Windows:
  ```BatchFile
  <clone root>\az.bat [commands]
  ```
  which is equivalent to the following:
  ```BatchFile
  <clone root>\src\python -m azure.cli [commands]
  ```

##Running Unit Tests:
####Command line
#####Windows:
  Provided your PYTHONPATH was set correcltly, from `<clone root>` run:
  ```BatchFile
  python -m unittest discover -s src\azure\cli\tests
  ``` 
####VS Code
  Under construction...
  
####Visual Studio
  Select `Test > Windows > Test Explorer` and click `Run All` in the Test Explorer pane.
