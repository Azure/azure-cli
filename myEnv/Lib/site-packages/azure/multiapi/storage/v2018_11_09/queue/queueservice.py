class QueueService(StorageClient):
    '''
    This is the main class managing queue resources.

    The Queue service stores messages. A queue can contain an unlimited number of 
    messages, each of which can be up to 64KB in size. Messages are generally added 
    to the end of the queue and retrieved from the front of the queue, although 
    first in, first out (FIFO) behavior is not guaranteed.

    :ivar function(data) encode_function: 
        A function used to encode queue messages. Takes as 
        a parameter the data passed to the put_message API and returns the encoded 
        message. Defaults to take text and xml encode, but bytes and other 
        encodings can be used. For example, base64 may be preferable for developing 
        across multiple Azure Storage libraries in different languages. See the 
        :class:`~azure.storage.queue.models.QueueMessageFormat` for xml, base64 and 
        no encoding methods as well as binary equivalents.
    :ivar function(data) decode_function: 
        A function used to encode decode messages. Takes as 
        a parameter the data returned by the get_messages and peek_messages APIs and 
        returns the decoded message. Defaults to return text and xml decode, but 
        bytes and other decodings can be used. For example, base64 may be preferable 
        for developing across multiple Azure Storage libraries in different languages. 
        See the :class:`~azure.storage.queue.models.QueueMessageFormat` for xml, base64 
        and no decoding methods as well as binary equivalents.
    :ivar object key_encryption_key:
        The key-encryption-key optionally provided by the user. If provided, will be used to
        encrypt/decrypt in supported methods.
        For methods requiring decryption, either the key_encryption_key OR the resolver must be provided.
        If both are provided, the resolver will take precedence.
        Must implement the following methods for APIs requiring encryption:
        wrap_key(key)--wraps the specified key (bytes) using an algorithm of the user's choice. Returns the encrypted key as bytes.
        get_key_wrap_algorithm()--returns the algorithm used to wrap the specified symmetric key.
        get_kid()--returns a string key id for this key-encryption-key.
        Must implement the following methods for APIs requiring decryption:
        unwrap_key(key, algorithm)--returns the unwrapped form of the specified symmetric key using the string-specified algorithm.
        get_kid()--returns a string key id for this key-encryption-key.
    :ivar function key_resolver_function(kid):
        A function to resolve keys optionally provided by the user. If provided, will be used to decrypt in supported methods.
        For methods requiring decryption, either the key_encryption_key OR
        the resolver must be provided. If both are provided, the resolver will take precedence.
        It uses the kid string to return a key-encryption-key implementing the interface defined above.
    :ivar bool require_encryption:
        A flag that may be set to ensure that all messages successfully uploaded to the queue and all those downloaded and
        successfully read from the queue are/were encrypted while on the server. If this flag is set, all required 
        parameters for encryption/decryption must be provided. See the above comments on the key_encryption_key and resolver.

        Updates the visibility timeout of a message. You can also use this
        operation to update the contents of a message.

        This operation can be used to continually extend the invisibility of a 
        queue message. This functionality can be useful if you want a worker role 
        to "lease" a queue message. For example, if a worker role calls get_messages 
        and recognizes that it needs more time to process a message, it can 
        continually extend the message's invisibility until it is processed. If 
        the worker role were to fail during processing, eventually the message 
        would become visible again and another worker role could process it.
