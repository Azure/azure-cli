        Hi @${author},

        This is not the official Azure CLI published by Microsoft.

        How to tell if the installed Azure CLI is unofficial:

        Hi @${author},

        ${currentVersion} is not the latest Azure CLI(${latestVersion}).

        If you haven't already attempted to do so, please upgrade to the latest Azure CLI version by following https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/update-azure-cli.
