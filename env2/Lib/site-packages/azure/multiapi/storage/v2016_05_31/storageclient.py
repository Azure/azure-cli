class StorageClient(object):

    '''
    This is the base class for service objects. Service objects are used to do 
    all requests to Storage. This class cannot be instantiated directly.

    :ivar str account_name:
        The storage account name. This is used to authenticate requests 
        signed with an account key and to construct the storage endpoint. It 
        is required unless a connection string is given, or if a custom 
        domain is used with anonymous authentication.
    :ivar str account_key:
        The storage account key. This is used for shared key authentication. 
        If neither account key or sas token is specified, anonymous access 
        will be used.
    :ivar str sas_token:
        A shared access signature token to use to authenticate requests 
        instead of the account key. If account key and sas token are both 
        specified, account key will be used to sign. If neither are 
        specified, anonymous access will be used.
    :ivar str primary_endpoint:
        The endpoint to send storage requests to.
    :ivar str secondary_endpoint:
        The secondary endpoint to read storage data from. This will only be a 
        valid endpoint if the storage account used is RA-GRS and thus allows 
        reading from secondary.
    :ivar function(context) retry:
        A function which determines whether to retry. Takes as a parameter a 
        :class:`~azure.storage.models.RetryContext` object. Returns the number 
        of seconds to wait before retrying the request, or None to indicate not 
        to retry.
    :ivar LocationMode location_mode:
        The host location to use to make requests. Defaults to LocationMode.PRIMARY.
        Note that this setting only applies to RA-GRS accounts as other account 
        types do not allow reading from secondary. If the location_mode is set to 
        LocationMode.SECONDARY, read requests will be sent to the secondary endpoint. 
        Write requests will continue to be sent to primary.
    :ivar str protocol:
        The protocol to use for requests. Defaults to https.
    :ivar requests.Session request_session:
        The session object to use for http requests.
    :ivar function(request) request_callback:
        A function called immediately before each request is sent. This function 
        takes as a parameter the request object and returns nothing. It may be 
        used to added custom headers or log request data.
    :ivar function() response_callback:
        A function called immediately after each response is received. This 
        function takes as a parameter the response object and returns nothing. 
        It may be used to log response data.
    :ivar function() retry_callback:
        A function called immediately after retry evaluation is performed. This 
        function takes as a parameter the retry context object and returns nothing. 
        It may be used to detect retries and log context information.
