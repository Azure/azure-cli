type: command
short-summary: Perform deployment using the kudu zip push deployment for a logic app.
long-summary: >
  By default Kudu assumes that zip deployments do not require any build-related actions like
  npm install or dotnet publish. This can be overridden by including an .deployment file in your
  zip file with the following content '[config] SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT = true',
  to enable Kudu detection logic and build script generation process.
  See https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Configurable-settings#enabledisable-build-actions-preview.
  Alternately the setting can be enabled using the az logicapp config appsettings set command.
examples:
- name: Perform deployment by using zip file content.
  text: >
      az logicapp deployment source config-zip \\
          -g {myRG} -n {myAppName} \\
          --src {zipFilePathLocation}
